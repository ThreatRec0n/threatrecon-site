# Platform Transformation Plan: Deep SOC Training Platform

## 🔍 Current State Audit

### What Exists (Basic)
- Simple IP marking game
- Basic alert classification
- Minimal log viewing
- Surface-level feedback
- No real SOC workflows
- No detection engineering
- No case management depth
- No guided learning paths

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **No Real SOC Workflow**: Missing alert triage, escalation, case documentation
2. **Shallow Learning**: No deep explanations of WHY, just WHAT
3. **Limited Log Sources**: Only basic Zeek/Suricata, missing EDR, Sysmon, CloudTrail
4. **No Attack Chains**: Scenarios don't follow MITRE ATT&CK kill chain
5. **No Detection Engineering**: Can't write/test YARA/Sigma rules
6. **No Evidence Management**: Missing bookmarks, notes, artifact linking
7. **No Role-Based Training**: Everyone does the same thing
8. **No Real Threat Intel**: Simulated but not realistic
9. **No Case Reports**: Missing professional documentation
10. **No Curriculum Structure**: No learning objectives or progression

## 🎯 Transformation Architecture

### Phase 1: Core SOC Infrastructure
1. **Alert Queue System** - Real triage workflow
2. **Case Management** - Deep incident tracking
3. **Evidence Workspace** - Bookmarks, notes, pinning
4. **Multi-Source Log Integration** - EDR, Sysmon, Zeek, CloudTrail

### Phase 2: Learning & Education
1. **Guided Walkthroughs** - Step-by-step with explanations
2. **MITRE ATT&CK Integration** - Full technique mapping
3. **Attack Chain Visualization** - See the full kill chain
4. **Benign vs Malicious Comparisons** - Side-by-side learning

### Phase 3: Detection Engineering
1. **Sigma Rule Builder** - Write and test rules
2. **YARA Rule Builder** - File-based detection
3. **Rule Testing Engine** - Test against log data
4. **Detection Library** - Share and learn rules

### Phase 4: Professional Workflows
1. **Case Report Generator** - Professional documentation
2. **Threat Intel Integration** - Real lookups and enrichment
3. **Response Recommendations** - Actionable next steps
4. **Role-Based Scenarios** - Tier 1, Tier 2, Detection Engineer

### Phase 5: Curriculum & Progression
1. **Learning Paths** - Structured progression
2. **Skill Assessments** - Measure competency
3. **Certification Tracks** - Professional validation
4. **Community Features** - Share findings, collaborate
