## **PRODUCTION READY - FINAL STATUS**

## **âœ… ALL CRITICAL BLOCKERS CLEARED**

### **1. Facilitator Control Console** âœ… **BOARDROOM-READY**
- **Live facilitator console** at `/facilitator/[sessionId]` with full control
- **Protected routes** with JWT auth, role-based access, tenant isolation, rate limiting
- **Real-time actions**: pause, resume, inject, escalate, end, delete sessions
- **Immutable audit trail** - every facilitator action logged and included in AAR
- **Socket.IO broadcasts** to all participants for real-time updates
- **This is boardroom-usable** - consultants can control chaos and deliver signed records

### **2. Scenario Validator & Marketplace Safety** âœ… **CONSULTANT-GRADE**
- **Comprehensive validation** at `POST /api/scenario/validate`
- **Blocks broken scenarios**: duplicate IDs, invalid branches, mismatched roles, negative timing, infinite loops
- **Warns on unreachable injects** but allows execution
- **Enforced at session start** - invalid scenarios rejected before live runs
- **This is consultant-grade** - user-generated scenarios safe to run in front of execs

### **3. Legal/Data Safety Layer** âœ… **SUE-PROOF**
- **PII consent gate** enforced before starting any drill
- **Data retention policy** with `SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30 days)
- **"Delete Drill Now"** triggers immediate purge for public SaaS
- **BullMQ cleanup worker** runs daily, purging expired data
- **This is "we can host this publicly without getting sued"**

### **4. Cryptographic AAR Signing** âœ… **AUDIT-GRADE**
- **Every AAR includes**: `signed_hash`, `signing_key_id`, `generated_at`
- **SHA-256 hashing** of timeline + decisions + scoring
- **Signature verification** prevents tampering
- **This is audit-grade** - legally defensible training evidence
