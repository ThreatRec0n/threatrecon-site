## 🎯 When You Might Need to Upgrade

You'd only need to upgrade if:
1. **>50,000 monthly active users** (very unlikely for a training platform)
2. **>500 MB database** (unlikely unless storing lots of simulation data)
3. **>2 GB bandwidth/month** (unlikely unless very popular)
4. **Need advanced features** like:
   - Custom SMTP for emails
   - Advanced security features
   - Priority support
   - Custom domains for auth

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Free tier includes**: SSL/TLS encryption, Row Level Security (RLS), GDPR compliance
- **No data limits** on security features
- **Same security** as paid plans

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Start with the free tier!** It's more than enough for:
- User accounts
- Progress tracking
- Case notes
- Achievements
- Leaderboards
- Feedback storage

You can always upgrade later if you grow beyond the free tier limits (which is unlikely for a training platform).

**Answer**: **NO!** Supabase free tier is perfect for your platform. You can support thousands of users for free. Only upgrade if you become extremely popular (50,000+ monthly active users).
