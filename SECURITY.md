# ThreatRecon Platform - Security Documentation

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

The ThreatRecon platform implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect sensitive incident response data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### **IMPORTANT: Public SaaS Safety Rules**

**Do not enter real personal data, regulated data, PHI, or production secrets in the hosted service.**

- **Hosted drills auto-delete after SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS (default: 7 days)**
- **You can purge a drill at any time using the "Delete Drill Now" button**
- **All facilitator actions are logged and included in the signed AAR**
- **If you need to run a drill using real names, actual escalation paths, or live communications structure, deploy ThreatRecon on-prem using the Docker Compose bundle**

### **Audit Log Tamper Resistance**
- **Immutable Audit Trails**: All facilitator actions are cryptographically signed and cannot be modified
- **AAR Signing**: After Action Reports include cryptographic hashes and signing metadata
- **Chain of Custody**: Complete timeline of all decisions and actions with timestamps
- **Legal Defensibility**: Audit logs meet legal standards for incident response documentation

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions system
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements with bcrypt hashing (12 rounds)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Ready for 2FA implementation

### 2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Joi schemas for all API endpoints
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- **XSS Protection**: Content sanitization and CSP headers
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation, size limits, and sanitization
- **Request Size Limiting**: Protection against large payload attacks

### 3. **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**
- **Multi-tier Rate Limiting**: Different limits for different endpoint types
- **IP-based Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: Specific limits for login attempts
- **Session Creation Limits**: Prevention of session spam

### 4. **Security Headers**
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP with nonce support
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Force HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevent clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevent MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Control referrer information leakage

### 5. **Data Protection**
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption for sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS/SSL for all communications
- **Data Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old data
- **PII Protection**: Consent mechanisms and data anonymization
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all actions

### 6. **Database Security**
- **Connection Pooling**: Secure connection management
- **Query Parameterization**: Prevention of SQL injection
- **Connection Encryption**: SSL/TLS for database connections
- **Access Control**: Database user permissions and roles

### 7. **API Security**
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure API access
- **Request Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Response Sanitization**: Clean output to prevent data leakage
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin policies

## üöÄ Performance Monitoring

### Vercel Speed Insights Integration
- **Real User Monitoring**: Track actual user experience metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP, FID, CLS, and other performance metrics
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed performance breakdowns
- **Mobile & Desktop**: Separate tracking for different device types

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
All security-relevant events are logged with:
- **Timestamp**: Precise timing of events
- **User Identification**: Who performed the action
- **Action Type**: What was done
- **IP Address**: Source of the request
- **User Agent**: Browser/client information
- **Metadata**: Additional context

### Security Alerts
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Rate Limit Violations**: Detection of potential attacks
- **Suspicious Activity**: Pattern detection and alerting
- **Data Access**: Monitoring of sensitive data access

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
All security settings are configurable via environment variables. See `env.template` for complete configuration options.

### Critical Security Settings
```bash
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_minimum_32_characters_long
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

# Password Security
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=5

# Data Retention
SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=30
AUTO_DELETE_ENABLED=true
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Change Default Secrets**: Never use default secrets in production
2. **Regular Key Rotation**: Rotate JWT secrets and encryption keys regularly
3. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly review security logs for anomalies
4. **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date
5. **Backup Security**: Ensure secure backup procedures

### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
3. **Dependency Management**: Use only trusted dependencies
4. **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in development process
